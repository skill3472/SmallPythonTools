## Small Python Tools
is a collection of small tools I've written for my own purposes and use in Python. If you find any of them useful, feel free to use them.
Below, you can find a short description of each tool, which will be updated, if any are added.

## FolderUnpacker.py
Is a tool, for *"unpacking"* folders. For ex, this directory structure:
```
Parent Directory/
├─ Name1/
│  ├─ file1.pdf
├─ Name2/
│  ├─ file2.exe
├─ Name3/
│  ├─ file3.mp3
```
after using this tool, with the path to "Parent Directory", turns into:
```
Parent Directory/
├─ Name1.pdf
├─ Name2.exe
├─ Name3.mp3
```
